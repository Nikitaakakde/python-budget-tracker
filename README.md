## Project Description

The Python Budget Tracker is a command-line based financial tracking tool designed to help users manage their income and expenses using a simple CSV-based system. This application is ideal for beginners learning Python, and for anyone who wants a lightweight personal finance tracker without the complexity of databases or external libraries.

### Key Highlights:

1. **CSV-Based Data Storage**  
   - All transactions are stored in a standard `transactions.csv` file.  
   - Data persists across sessions and can be easily opened or modified using any spreadsheet software.

2. **Add Income and Expense Transactions**  
   - Users can record multiple income or expense entries.  
   - Each entry requires a description and an amount.  
   - Expense amounts are stored as negative values to simplify balance calculation.

3. **View Real-Time Balance**  
   - The total balance is calculated dynamically by summing all recorded transactions.  
   - Helps users quickly understand their current financial position.

4. **Transaction History**  
   - Displays all recorded income and expense entries in a readable format.  
   - Useful for tracking spending patterns or reviewing past inputs.

5. **User-Friendly Command Line Interface (CLI)**  
   - Clear menu-driven options for interacting with the application.  
   - Validations are in place to handle incorrect inputs and ensure proper data entry.

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   - Can be executed on any machine with Python 3.x installed.  
   - Fully functional in cloud environments like Google Colab with minor adjustments to file paths.

7. **Beginner-Friendly Python Concepts Covered**  
   - File input/output with CSV  
   - Reading and writing dictionaries  
   - Loops, conditionals, and input validation  
   - Modular function-based code structure  
   - Basic arithmetic and string formatting

8. **Lightweight and Dependency-Free**  
   - No external libraries requiredâ€”uses only built-in Python modules (`csv` and `os`).  
   - Simple enough to be used as a starter project in Python learning programs.

9. **Expandable for Advanced Features**  
   - Can be extended to support categories (e.g., Food, Rent, Travel).  
   - Future enhancements can include date filters, monthly summaries, pie charts, or integration with a GUI framework like Tkinter or a web framework like Flask.

10. **Use Cases**  
    - Personal finance tracking for students and individuals.  
    - Educational tool for Python practice.  
    - Prototype for building more advanced finance applications.
