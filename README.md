# Python Budget Tracker

A simple command-line budget tracker built with Python that stores data in a CSV file. Ideal for beginners looking to practice file handling, user input, and basic data processing in Python.

## Project Description

The Python Budget Tracker is a lightweight, terminal-based application designed to help users manage their personal finances. It enables users to add income and expense transactions, view their current balance, and list all previous transactions. The data is stored persistently in a CSV file, allowing users to track and review their financial activity across sessions.

This project is especially suitable for Python learners who want hands-on experience with fundamental concepts such as file I/O, data structures, and input validation. The codebase is simple and easy to extend, making it a great starting point for building more advanced personal finance tools.
